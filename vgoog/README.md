## Philosophy

**Your tools should be faster than your thoughts.**

Every second you spend clicking through browser tabs, waiting for web UIs to load, and context-switching between Google apps is a second you're not doing real work. vgoog exists because managing Google Workspace from a browser is an unacceptably slow way to operate.

We believe:

- **The terminal is the power user's home.** If you live in the terminal, your Google Workspace should live there too. No Electron apps. No browser tabs. No loading spinners.
- **One interface, ten services.** You shouldn't need ten different apps to manage ten Google services. You need one. With consistent navigation, consistent keybindings, and zero learning curve between services.
- **Speed is a feature.** vgoog is written in Rust with async I/O, compiles to a 3.4MB static binary, starts instantly, and renders at 60fps. The only bottleneck is Google's API latency — and we handle pagination and token refresh transparently so you never wait for anything we control.
- **Text is the universal interface.** Every API response is browsable as structured JSON. Every action is a form you can fill out with your keyboard. No mouse required. No GUIs. Just text, terminals, and keystrokes.
- **Completeness matters.** vgoog doesn't just list your emails and call it a day. It exposes 219 API methods across 10 services — messages, threads, labels, drafts, filters, settings, delegates, forwarding, send-as aliases, calendar events with attendees, drive file uploads with multipart encoding, spreadsheet cell manipulation, document formatting, presentation slide management, form question builders, task hierarchies, contact groups, Apps Script deployments and remote execution. If Google's API supports it, vgoog lets you do it.
- **Trust the operator.** vgoog gives you the raw power of Google's APIs without hiding behind "are you sure?" dialogs for every action. Destructive operations get a single confirm prompt. Everything else executes immediately. You're an adult. You know what you're doing.

## Setup

On first launch, vgoog walks you through configuration. You name the account and paste your OAuth credentials:

```
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║     vgoog — Google Workspace TUI      ║
  ║          First-time Setup              ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

  Account name (e.g. work, personal): work
  Display label (e.g. Work Gmail): Work Gmail

  ── Manual Token Entry ──

  Get tokens from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  Or use the OAuth Playground: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/

  GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: ****
  GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: ****
  GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN: ****
  GOOGLE_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN: ****
```

You need a Client ID, Client Secret, Access Token, and Refresh Token. See [Getting OAuth Credentials](#getting-oauth-credentials) below for step-by-step instructions. Once configured, vgoog automatically refreshes your access token when it expires — you never paste tokens again.

### Multi-Account Support

vgoog supports multiple Google accounts. Add as many as you need — work, personal, client accounts, etc.

Credentials are saved to `~/.config/vgoog/config.toml`:

```toml
active_account = "work"

[accounts.work]
label = "Work Gmail"

[accounts.work.auth]
client_id = "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret = "GOCSPX-..."
access_token = "ya29.a0..."
refresh_token = "1//0e..."
token_expiry = 2026-02-20T12:00:00Z

[accounts.personal]
label = "Personal"

[accounts.personal.auth]
client_id = "..."
client_secret = "..."
access_token = "..."
refresh_token = "..."
token_expiry = 2026-02-20T12:00:00Z
```

Switch between accounts instantly with `Ctrl+A` inside the TUI. The active account is displayed in the header bar. Switching resets your view back to service selection so you start fresh with the new account's data.

vgoog automatically refreshes your access token when it expires (with a 2-minute safety buffer), saves the new token to disk, and never interrupts your workflow.

### Getting OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create a project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable the APIs listed above under **Library**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth Client ID**
5. Application type → **Desktop app**
6. Note down your Client ID and Client Secret
7. Use the [OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) to obtain access + refresh tokens with the scopes below

### Authentication

Three ways in. `vgoog` with nothing configured runs the wizard and offers all three.

**1. Sign in with Google (recommended)**

```bash
vgoog login
```

Opens a browser, catches the redirect on a loopback port, exchanges the code itself. Create a
**Desktop app** OAuth client in the [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
and that is the whole setup — no redirect URIs to register, no OAuth Playground.

Credentials can also come from the environment, which is what makes this work straight after
`vaulty secrets pull`:

```bash
vgoog login              # reads VGOOG_CLIENT_ID / VGOOG_CLIENT_SECRET
vgoog login --client-id ... --client-secret ...
```

**2. Service account (Workspace only, deepest access)**

```bash
vgoog login --service-account ~/Downloads/key.json --subject you@yourdomain.com
```

No browser, no refresh token, works headless and in CI, and reaches Workspace-admin surfaces that
user consent cannot. Requires two things first:

- the service account has **domain-wide delegation** enabled, and you have its JSON key
- its **client id** is authorised in admin.google.com → Security → Access and data control →
  API controls → Domain-wide delegation, against the scopes below

> **Workspace access is not GCP IAM.** Giving the service account an IAM role in the Cloud console
> grants it nothing in Gmail, Drive or Calendar — those permissions live in the Workspace admin
> console and are granted separately. There are two ways to grant them:
>
> | | Direct sharing | Domain-wide delegation |
> |---|---|---|
> | How | Share one resource with the service account's email as Editor | Authorise its client id against a scope list |
> | Needs | Nothing special | A Workspace **Super Admin** |
> | Reaches | That one Drive folder / calendar | Every service, as any user in the domain |
> | Gmail | **No** — a mailbox cannot be shared with a robot | Yes |
>
> `vgoog` uses delegation, because Gmail is the point.

**3. Paste tokens by hand** — offered by the wizard when you already have them.

### Restoring from the vault

`vgoog` rebuilds itself from `~/.config/secrets.env` when it has no usable config of its own —
written by `vaulty secrets pull`. Either credential kind restores:

```
VGOOG_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY   the key file, minified to one line
VGOOG_SUBJECTS              comma-separated addresses — ONE ACCOUNT EACH, first is the default
```

or, for OAuth:

```
VGOOG_CLIENT_ID  VGOOG_CLIENT_SECRET  VGOOG_REFRESH_TOKEN
```

A delegated key wins when both are present. Nothing to run: the next `vgoog` command picks it up
and writes its own config.

### Required Scopes

`vgoog scopes` prints them, ready to paste:

```bash
vgoog scopes         # the 15 an OAuth login requests
vgoog scopes --all   # 17, adding the Workspace-admin scopes a delegated key can use
```

### Checking it works

```bash
vgoog doctor
```

Reports every account, which kind of credential it holds, whether it is usable, and — the only
check that means anything — whether it can actually reach Google right now.

---

## Usage

```bash
vgoog
```

That's it. You'll see the service selection screen. Navigate with your keyboard. Everything is a keystroke away.

### Key Design Decisions

- **No generated client code.** Every API call is hand-written with the exact URL, method, and JSON body. This means no OpenAPI codegen bloat, no version mismatches, and total control over every request.
- **`serde_json::Value` as the lingua franca.** API responses are returned as raw JSON values. This keeps the type surface small, avoids 500 struct definitions for 10 different APIs, and lets users browse the actual API response in the detail view.
- **Async all the way down.** Tokio runtime, async HTTP client, async token refresh. The TUI never blocks on I/O.
- **Multi-account from day one.** Every account is a named profile in a single TOML config file. Switching accounts is a single `Ctrl+A` hotkey. Token refresh happens per-account transparently.
- **One-time setup, zero friction.** Paste your OAuth credentials once during setup. Token refresh happens automatically forever after — you never touch tokens again.
- **Single binary, zero runtime dependencies.** Compiles with rustls (no OpenSSL), LTO, single codegen unit, stripped symbols. The result is a static 3.4MB binary that runs anywhere.

## Error Handling

vgoog surfaces errors transparently in the status bar:

| Error Type | When |
|-----------|------|
| `Auth error` | Token refresh fails (invalid credentials, revoked access) |
| `API error (4xx/5xx)` | Google API returns an error (quota, permission, bad request) |
| `Rate limited` | 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after |
| `Not found` | Resource doesn't exist |
| `Config error` | Missing or malformed config file |
| `HTTP error` | Network connectivity issues |

Errors are never swallowed. If something fails, you see exactly what Google told us.

---

## Build

```bash
# Development (fast compile, debug symbols)
cargo build

# Release (optimized, LTO, stripped — 3.4MB)
cargo build --release

# Run directly
cargo run --release
```

### Build Profile

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3       # Maximum optimization
lto = true          # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1   # Single codegen unit for best optimization
strip = true        # Strip debug symbols
```

| File paths | Handled by `PathBuf` | POSIX | POSIX |

Every dependency was chosen to be cross-platform. `reqwest` uses `rustls-tls` so there is no OpenSSL dependency to wrestle with on any OS. `crossterm` talks directly to the Windows console API — no WSL or MSYS2 required. `dirs` resolves config directories correctly per-platform.

> **Note for Windows users:** The service menu uses emoji icons (📧 📅 📁 etc.). These render correctly in **Windows Terminal** and the default terminal on **Windows 11**. Legacy `cmd.exe` on older Windows 10 builds may display them as boxes. This is purely cosmetic — all functionality works regardless. We recommend [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) for the best experience.
